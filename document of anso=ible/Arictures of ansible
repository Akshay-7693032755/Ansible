Ansible Architecture
Control node: Commands and Playbooks can run by invoking /usr/bin/ansible or /usr/bin/ansible-playbook, from any control node. You can use any computer that has Python installed on it as a control node. However, one can not use a computer with Windows OS as a control node. One can have multiple control nodes.
Managed nodes: Also sometimes called “hosts”, Managed nodes are the network devices (and/or servers) you manage with Ansible.
Inventory: Also sometimes called “hostfile”, Inventory is the list of Managed nodes use to organize them. It is also used for creating and nesting groups for easier scaling.
Modules: These are the units of code executed by Ansible. Each module can be used for a specific purpose. One can invoke a single module with a task, or invoke several different modules in a playbook.
Tasks: The units of action in Ansible. One can execute a single task once with an ad-hoc command.
